# Approx_Function
The point was not only to just approx function basing on input data, but to do it in a bit inconventional way. I didn't make any calculation to receive a proper formula, only few to check if genereted one is fine or not. I wanted to show how the evolution work and how to give a good quality solution making random changes. 
Of course, the code has to be refactored for every specific problem.
